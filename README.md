# WildInspect

WildInspect 2 - Give your players the ability to inspect blocks inside their claims!

## Compiling

I am compiling it using the built-in system of Intellij. There is only one module for this project, and it has the following dependencies:

- v1_8_R3 jar (1.8.8 spigot jar)
   
- all the libraries from the libs folder (their order shouldn't matter, but it might cause issues).

## Credits

â€¢ Ome_R for the base-code.
